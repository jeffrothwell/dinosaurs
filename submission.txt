1. SELECT count(*) FROM dinos; => 331 dinosaurs
2. SELECT * FROM dinos WHERE period = 'Jurassic'; - this works
3. SELECT sum(length) FROM dinos WHERE period = 'Cretaceous'; => 1366.45
4. SELECT * FROM dinos WHERE period = 'Jurassic' OR period = 'Cretaceous' ORDER BY species ASC;
5. SELECT * FROM dinos WHERE t_order = 'Saurischia' AND diet = 'Herbivorous';
6. UPDATE dinos SET name = 'Shortie' WHERE length = (SELECT MIN(length) FROM dinos);
7. SELECT name FROM dinos ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 5;
